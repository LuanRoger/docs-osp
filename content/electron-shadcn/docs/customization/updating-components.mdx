electron-shadcn includes a convenient script to update all your shadcn/ui components at once. This ensures you always have the latest versions with bug fixes and improvements.

## Why Update Components?

Since shadcn/ui components are copied into your project (not installed as dependencies), they won't automatically update when new versions are released. Regular updates give you:

- **Bug fixes**: Resolved issues and improved stability
- **New features**: Enhanced functionality and variants
- **Accessibility improvements**: Better ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Performance optimizations**: Faster rendering and reduced bundle size

<Callout type="warn">
Updating components will overwrite your local changes. If you've customized any components in `src/components/ui`, make sure to back them up or use version control before updating.
</Callout>

## Updating All Components

The easiest way to update all components is using the `bump-ui` script:

```bash
npm run bump-ui
```

This script will:
1. Scan your `src/components/ui` directory
2. Identify all installed shadcn/ui components
3. Reinstall each component with the latest version
4. Overwrite existing files with the `-o` flag

### How It Works

The script automatically detects all `.tsx` files in your components directory and updates them:

```bash
# Equivalent to running:
npx shadcn@latest add -y -o button card dialog dropdown-menu ...
```

The flags used are:
- `-y`: Automatically confirm the installation
- `-o`: Overwrite existing files

## Updating Specific Components

If you only want to update specific components, you can do it manually:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add -o <component-name>
```

For example, to update just the Button component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add -o button
```

### Updating Multiple Specific Components

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add -o button card dialog
```

## Custom Component Directory

If you've configured a custom path for your UI components, you can pass it to the script:

```bash
npm run bump-ui src/custom/ui/path
```

The script will look for components in the specified directory instead of the default `src/components/ui`.

## Best Practices

<Steps>
<Step>
### Commit Your Changes

Before updating, make sure all your changes are committed to version control:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Save work before updating components"
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Backup Custom Components

If you've customized components, create a backup:

```bash
# Create a backup of customized components
cp src/components/ui/button.tsx src/components/ui/button.backup.tsx
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Run the Update

```bash
npm run bump-ui
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Review Changes

Check what changed using git:

```bash
git diff src/components/ui
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Restore Customizations

If you had customizations, carefully merge them back into the updated components:

```tsx
// Restore your custom variants or modifications
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center...",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90",
        // Your custom variant
        brand: "bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700",
      },
    },
  }
);
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Test Your Application

Run your tests and manually test affected components:

```bash
npm run test
npm run start
```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Checking for Updates

To check if updates are available, visit the [shadcn/ui changelog](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/changelog) or the component pages on the shadcn/ui website.
