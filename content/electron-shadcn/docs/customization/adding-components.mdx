electron-shadcn comes pre-configured with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), a collection of beautifully designed, accessible components that you can copy and paste into your app.

## Adding shadcn/ui Components

shadcn/ui components are not installed as dependencies. Instead, they are copied into your project, giving you full control over their code and styling.

### Using the CLI

The easiest way to add components is using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

For example, to add the Button component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

### Adding Multiple Components

You can add multiple components at once:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button card dialog dropdown-menu
```

### Interactive Mode

Run the CLI without arguments to enter interactive mode:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add
```

This will show you a list of all available components to choose from.

## Component Location

All shadcn/ui components are stored in the `src/components/ui` directory. This is configured in the `components.json` file at the root of the project.

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/           # shadcn/ui components
│   │   ├── button.tsx
│   │   ├── card.tsx
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...           # Your custom components
```

<Callout type="info">
Keep shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui` and your custom components in `src/components` to maintain a clean project structure.
</Callout>

## Customizing Components

Since components are copied into your project, you can freely customize them.

### Modifying Styles

Edit the component file directly in `src/components/ui`:

```tsx
// src/components/ui/button.tsx
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center...",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90",
        // Add your custom variant
        brand: "bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700",
      },
      // ...
    },
  }
);
```

### Creating Custom Variants

Add new variants to existing components:

```tsx
<Button variant="brand">Brand Button</Button>
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep ui components separate**: Don't modify files in `src/components/ui` unless you're customizing the component itself
- **Use composition**: Build complex UIs by composing smaller shadcn/ui components
- **Follow the path alias**: Always import from `@/components/ui` for consistency
- **Check for updates**: Occasionally check [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for component updates and new additions
