The `publish` command creates distributables and uploads them to GitHub Releases.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Configure Repository Information

Update `forge.config.ts` with your repository details:

```ts
publishers: [
  {
    name: "@electron-forge/publisher-github",
    config: {
      repository: {
        owner: "your-username",
        name: "your-repository",
      },
      draft: true,
      prerelease: false,
    },
  },
],
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Set Up GitHub Token

Create a GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` permissions and set it as an environment variable:

<Tabs items={["Windows", "macOS/Linux"]}>
<Tab value="Windows">
```powershell
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
npm run publish
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="macOS/Linux">
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
npm run publish
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>

<Step>
### Update Version

Before publishing, update the version in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.1"
}
```

The version number will be used as the release tag.
</Step>

<Step>
### Publish

Run the publish command:

```bash
npm run publish
```

This will create a draft release on GitHub with the built artifacts attached.
</Step>
</Steps>

By default, releases are created as drafts. Review and edit the release description on GitHub before publishing it to users.
</Callout>


## Using GitHub Actions

electron-shadcn includes a pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow for automated publishing.

The workflow is located at `.github/workflows/publish.yml` and can be triggered manually from the Actions tab in your repository.

### Workflow Features

- Builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Automatically creates GitHub Releases
- Uploads all platform artifacts
- Creates draft releases for review

### Running the Workflow

The publish workflow needs to be triggered manually, this allows you to control when releases are created.

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Actions** → **Publish Release**
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select the branch and confirm

## Build Configuration

The build configuration is managed in `forge.config.ts`. Here you can customize:

- **App metadata**: Name, description, icons
- **Makers**: Configure installers for each platform
- **Publishers**: Set up release destinations
- **Plugins**: Vite bundler configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Code Signing Issues on macOS

For distribution outside the Mac App Store, you need to notarize your app. See the [Electron documentation on notarization](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/code-signing).
