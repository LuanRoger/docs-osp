electron-shadcn comes with pre-configured GitHub Actions workflows for testing, linting, formatting, and publishing your Electron application. This guide covers how to use and customize these workflows for your needs.

## Overview

The template includes the following workflows:

| Workflow | File | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tests | `.github/workflows/tests.yml` | Runs Playwright e2e tests on pull requests |
| Lint | `.github/workflows/lint.yml` | Runs ESLint to check code quality |
| Check formatting | `.github/workflows/format.yml` | Checks code formatting with Prettier |
| Publish Release | `.github/workflows/publish.yml` | Builds and publishes releases to GitHub |

## Tests Workflow

The tests workflow automatically runs Playwright end-to-end tests when you open a pull request or push to the main branch.

### What It Does

1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Node.js
3. Installs dependencies
4. Builds the application
5. Runs Playwright tests
6. Reports test results

## Cross-Platform Considerations

### Testing

The test workflow only runs on Ubuntu, the E2E tests runs on Windows. If you need to target other platforms, you can modify the workflow to include additional OSes.

### Publishing

The publish workflow builds the application only for Windows by default. To build for macOS and Linux, you need to run the workflow on those respective OS runners.

## Lint Workflow

The lint workflow runs ESLint to check your code for potential issues and enforce code standards.

### When It Runs

- On every pull request to `main`
- On every push to `main`

This ensures all code merged into the main branch follows consistent coding standards.

## Check Formatting Workflow

The formatting workflow uses Prettier to verify that all code follows consistent formatting rules.

### When It Runs

- On every pull request to `main`
- On every push to `main`

<Callout type="warn">
If formatting checks fail, run `npm run format:write` locally to fix formatting issues before pushing. Some issues need to be resolved manually.
</Callout>

## Publish Workflow

The publish workflow builds your application for Windows and creates a GitHub Release with the built artifacts.

### Triggering the Workflow

The publish workflow is triggered manually from the GitHub Actions tab:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Navigate to Actions

Go to your repository on GitHub and click the **Actions** tab.
</Step>

<Step>
### Select the Workflow

Click on **Publish Release** in the workflows list.
</Step>

<Step>
### Run the Workflow

Click **Run workflow**, select the branch, and confirm.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up for Publishing

### Configure Repository Information

Before publishing, update `forge.config.ts` with your repository details:

```ts
publishers: [
  {
    name: "@electron-forge/publisher-github",
    config: {
      repository: {
        owner: "your-username",
        name: "your-repository",
      },
      draft: true,
      prerelease: false,
    },
  },
],
```

### GITHUB_TOKEN

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided by GitHub Actions. It has permission to:

- Create releases
- Upload release assets
- Read repository contents

<Callout type="warn">
The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` only has access to the current repository. For cross-repository operations, you'll need a Personal Access Token.
</Callout>

## Release Management

### Semantic Versioning

Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for your releases:

- **Major** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes
- **Minor** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **Patch** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes

Update the version in `package.json` before publishing:

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.0"
}
```

### Draft Releases

By default, releases are created as drafts. This allows you to:

1. Review the release before making it public
2. Edit the release notes
3. Verify all artifacts are correct

To publish the release:

1. Go to **Releases** in your repository
2. Find the draft release
3. Click **Edit**
4. Add release notes
5. Click **Publish release**

## Troubleshooting

### Windows Build Fails

Common issues on Windows:

- **Long path names**: Enable long paths in Git
- **Missing Visual Studio Build Tools**: The runner includes them by default

```yaml
- name: Configure Git
  run: git config --global core.longpaths true
```

### Lint or Format Checks Fail

If lint or formatting checks fail:

```bash
# Fix linting issues
npm run lint -- --fix

# Fix formatting issues
npm run format:write
```

Then commit and push the changes.

## Best Practices

- **Run checks locally first**: Use `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before pushing
- **Test before publishing**: Ensure all workflows pass before triggering a publish
- **Use draft releases**: Review releases before making them public
- **Keep secrets secure**: Never commit secrets to your repository
- **Pin action versions**: Use specific versions of actions (e.g., `actions/checkout@v4`)
- **Monitor workflow runs**: Check the Actions tab regularly for failed runs
