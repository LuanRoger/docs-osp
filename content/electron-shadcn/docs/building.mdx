electron-shadcn uses [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io) for building, packaging, and distributing your application. This guide covers the different build options available.

## Build Commands

There are three main commands for building your application, each serving a different purpose:

| Command | Description | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run package` | Creates an executable bundle | `out/` folder |
| `npm run make` | Creates platform-specific distributables | `.exe`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, etc. |
| `npm run publish` | Creates and publishes to GitHub Releases | GitHub Release |

## Packaging

The `package` command bundles your application into a platform-specific executable without creating an installer.

```bash
npm run package
```

This is useful for:
- Quick testing of the production build
- Running end-to-end tests with Playwright
- Development verification before creating distributables

The output will be in the `out/` directory.

## Creating Distributables

The `make` command generates platform-specific installers and distributables.

```bash
npm run make
```

<Tabs items={["Windows", "macOS", "Linux"]}>
<Tab value="Windows">
Generates:
- `.exe` installer (Squirrel.Windows)
- Portable executable

The installer includes automatic updates support and creates Start Menu shortcuts.
</Tab>
<Tab value="macOS">
Generates:
- `.dmg` disk image
- `.zip` archive

<Callout type="warn">
To sign your macOS app for distribution, you'll need an Apple Developer certificate. Without signing, users will see security warnings when opening the app.
</Callout>
</Tab>
<Tab value="Linux">
Generates:
- `.deb` package (Debian/Ubuntu)
- `.rpm` package (Fedora/RHEL)

These packages can be installed using the system package manager.
