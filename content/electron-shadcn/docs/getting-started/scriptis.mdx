Here are the most commonly used scripts:

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run start` | Start the app in development mode |
| `npm run package` | Package the app into an executable bundle |
| `npm run make` | Generate platform-specific distributables (.exe, .dmg, etc.) |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint to check code quality |
| `npm run format:write` | Format code with Prettier |
| `npm run test` | Run unit tests with Vitest |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run end-to-end tests with Playwright |

<Callout type="warn">
The Playwright tests require the app to be built first. Run `npm run package` or `npm run make` before running `npm run test:e2e`. Head over to the [Testing](../testing) page for more details.
